# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
The final project to complete Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021!



**Launchpad which will allow a user to buy token allocations in early stage crypto projects.**

Basicly the user will be able to visit the website and:
-read about the project, 
-see the tokenomics (prize per token, number of tokens per allocation, total numer of tokens in a deal)
-deposit funds by a MetaMask wallet
-claim the tokens into his MM, after the deposit.

The system will check if there is enough tokens left for the next deposit.

There will be a status bar how many tokens left.
